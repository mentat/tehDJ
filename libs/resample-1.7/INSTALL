INSTALL file for the resample package from the 
Digital Audio Resampling Home Page located at
http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/resample/.

Just say (as root)

	make install

to install the command-line programs 

	resample
	windowfilter 

in /usr/local/bin/, and their man pages 

	resample.1
	windowfilter.1

in /usr/local/man/man1/.  This should work without modifications on
most UNIX systems (all testing donw under Red Hat Linux 6.1).

Otherwise, you may first wish to edit the resample Makefile and modify
DSTROOT, INSTALLDIR and MANDIR, as appropriate.  The architecture flag
"-DLINUX" is only used by audio.c (from SNDLIB).

After installation, say

	make test

to run some simple resample tests.

That should do it, unless you want to change some compiler flags.
(See BASE_CFLAGS AND CFLAGS further down in the file.)
